            <p>Hi there! I am currently a student in the UW Coding Bootcamp. My professional background is as a registered dietitian, with five years working in public health. I am learning web development skills in order to make a career change that will better fit my & my family's life. Some of my hobbies including reading, traveling, walking my dogs, and going to concerts! Currently I work full time as a public health dietitian and study web development on the evenings and weekends. I hope you enjoy looking at the projects I have completed so far!</p>
